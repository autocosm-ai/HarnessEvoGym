HarnessEvoGym turns harness self-improvement into an experiment you can inspect:
choose **what evolves**, **where it works**, and **how evolution searches** as
independent components, while a frozen Controller owns permissions, evaluation,
promotion, rollback, and lineage.

~~~
Target × Environment × EvolutionRecipe
~~~

This separation lets the same population algorithm evolve an MSA Minimal Cowork
agent on real Office tasks, exercise a Reasoning pipeline, or accept a new
Harness and Benchmark through adapters—without moving the evaluator into the
mutable system.

## Why this exists

Letting a coding agent edit itself is easy. Knowing whether the new version is
actually better is the hard part. A useful RSI loop must stop the evolving agent
from changing its judge, leaking hidden tasks, writing outside the selected
module, or promoting a noisy tie.

HarnessEvoGym makes those boundaries executable:

| Concern                | HarnessEvoGym answer                                                   |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **What may change?**   | Target-owned Mutation Regions, translated into a one-round hard lease  |
| **Who may change it?** | A pluggable Updater such as Codex CLI or DeepSeek Harness               |
| **What proves value?** | Environment-owned tasks, verifier, metrics, and strict promotion gates |
| **How is it searched?**| Population topology + an independent module SearchStrategy             |
| **What stays trusted?**| Controller, Gateway, evaluator, split, credentials, and final set      |

## The model

| Layer                | Owns                                                                    | Does not own                         |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **Target**           | Harness source, H0 seed, runtime, validator, and mutable Region catalog | Tasks, scores, or promotion rules    |
| **Environment**      | Tasks, isolated workspace, verifier, and metrics                        | Candidate write permissions          |
| **Evolution Recipe** | Population mode, branches, budget, sharing, and module search           | Harness-specific file paths          |
| **Controller**       | Scheduling, MutationLease, Diff Guard, lineage, promotion, and rollback | A mutable solution strategy           |

One Candidate generation follows:

~~~
Champion
  -> SearchStrategy selects Target Region IDs
  -> Controller issues a MutationLease
  -> Updater diagnoses failures and edits one Candidate
  -> Controller recomputes and validates the full diff
  -> Solver runs feedback + selection tasks
  -> strict gates promote the Candidate, or retain the Champion
~~~

The prompt tells the Updater *why* and *how* to improve. The MutationLease,
semantic validator, and Diff Guard enforce *where* it can write.

## What works today

| Capability              | Implemented                                                        |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Harness Targets         | MSA Minimal Cowork, MSA Minimal Reasoning, DeepSeek Harness path   |
| Updaters                | Isolated Codex CLI 0.149.1 and DeepSeek Harness                    |
| Environments            | OmegaUse-OfficeVal, synthetic text Reasoning, HLE/Putnam paths     |
| Population topologies   | Single, Independent, Mutualism, Competition, Combined              |
| Module search           | Linear hill climb, progressive risk expansion, Docker strategy API |
| Mutable risk ceilings   | Target-defined L1/L2/L3 with different files for every Harness     |
| Reliability             | Provider retries, per-task checkpoints, explicit Resume, sealed Final |

The real Cowork path uses
[OmegaUse-OfficeVal](https://github.com/baidu-frontier-research/OmegaUse-OfficeVal).
Of 100 upstream tasks, 91 have a registered Linux path:
**55 feedback/train + 18 selection/validation + 18 one-time sealed final**.
The Solver receives only the task and original Office inputs; scoring runs
offline in a separate read-only verifier container.

Synthetic text Reasoning is a connectivity test, not an HLE score. PI Agent
files are adapter examples, not a completed integration. See
[current boundaries](docs/architecture.md#implemented-paths-and-current-boundary) before reporting results.

## Five population modes

| Mode              | Branch behavior                                             |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `single`          | One Branch receives the entire Candidate budget             |
| `independent`     | Multiple Branches search without sharing history            |
| `mutualism`       | Independent search plus read-only peer evolution evidence   |
| `competition`     | Branches compete for an additional Candidate budget pool    |
| `combined`        | Peer evidence sharing plus budget competition               |

Population mode and module search are orthogonal. For example,
`combined + linear-hill-climb` and
`combined + progressive-risk-expansion` are both valid recipes.

## Quick start

Requirements: Linux, Docker, Node.js 20+, npm, and Git.

~~~bash
git clone https://github.com/DeepThinkingZhouLiu/HarnessEvoGym.git
cd HarnessEvoGym
npm ci
npm run check
npm test
~~~

Validate a complete composition without calling a model:

~~~bash
npm run rsi -- experiment validate \
  --config experiments/reasoning-msa-progressive-strict-smoke.json
~~~

Real runs inject credentials only at runtime:

~~~bash
export RSI_PROVIDER_BASE_URL=https://provider.example/v1
read -rsp 'Provider API Key: ' RSI_PROVIDER_API_KEY
export RSI_PROVIDER_API_KEY

npm run rsi -- runtime build \
  --experiment experiments/reasoning-msa-progressive-strict-smoke.json
npm run rsi -- experiment run \
  --config experiments/reasoning-msa-progressive-strict-smoke.json \
  --run-id reasoning-progressive-001

unset RSI_PROVIDER_API_KEY
~~~

Never write a real key into an Experiment, Adapter, Candidate, trace, or Git.
For OfficeVal dataset setup, task images, Resume, and sealed Final, use the
[Cowork runbook](docs/cowork-mvp.md).

For hidden-test scores only, use `experiment finalize --run <run> --final-only`.
For cross-mode comparisons, `experiment finalize-suite --config <shared-final.json>`
evaluates one shared H0 and each frozen champion without retraining. The new suite
supports identity-locked task resume, persistent retry limits, and explicit reasoning-only
response compatibility. Existing `finalize` rules are unchanged.
See [shared final evaluation](docs/shared-final-suite.zh.md).
This skips feedback replay, keeps H0/the Champion frozen, and leaves the
train–test generalization gap unset. OmegaUse Final retries an uncommitted task
up to five additional times for observed upstream stream/transport errors or
transient HTTP errors (5/10/20/40/60-second backoff; configurable with
`--infrastructure-retries 0..5`). Failed workspaces are archived; committed
results, including valid zero scores, are never rerun. Authentication errors,
candidate errors, verifier failures and low scores do not trigger retries.
This is bounded retry within the same Final claim, not cross-process Final
resume. Exhaustion still fails without fabricating scores or unsealing Final
again. Other environments retain their previous behavior.

Infrastructure failures become `PAUSED_INFRASTRUCTURE` and fail the command
instead of masquerading as a zero-score success. `experiment resume` continues
the same Population after the fault is repaired. Gateway request limits are
currently scoped per Branch rather than as one Population-wide cost ceiling.
Production HLE/PutnamBench retains its dedicated runtime and sealed broker; the
public smoke suite is not a substitute for a production benchmark.

## Registered five-mode Cowork suite

The repository includes a fixed formal training configuration:

| Setting                 | Value                                                     |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Target / Solver         | MSA Minimal Cowork, full 12-step runtime                  |
| Updater                 | Isolated Codex CLI 0.149.1                                |
| Solver + Updater model  | `gpt-5.6-terra`, high reasoning, 8192 output tokens       |
| Search space            | L1 prompt/skills + L2 agent loop/tool runtime             |
| Search strategy         | `linear-hill-climb`                                       |
| Candidate budget        | 32 per Mode                                               |
| Branches                | Single = 1; the other four Modes = 2                      |
| Suite concurrency       | Up to 2 Modes; up to 2 Office tasks per Branch            |
| Data                    | 55 feedback + 18 selection; sealed final remains unopened |
| Seed / trials           | One preregistered seed, one trial per task                |

The five Experiments live under
[`experiments/cowork-msa-rsi-formal32-codex-*.json`](experiments/), and the
auditable runner is
[`scripts/run-cowork-formal32-five-mode.mjs`](scripts/run-cowork-formal32-five-mode.mjs).

~~~bash
export RSI_OFFICEVAL_DATASET_ROOT=/absolute/path/to/OmegaUse-OfficeVal-Dataset
export RSI_OFFICEVAL_EVALUATOR_ROOT=/absolute/path/to/OmegaUse-OfficeVal
export RSI_SUITE_MAX_CONCURRENT_MODES=2

node scripts/run-cowork-formal32-five-mode.mjs
~~~

This is a complete RSI configuration, not yet a publication-grade statistical
claim. A formal comparison should preregister multiple seeds/trials and report
reward, Solver/Updater tokens, wall time, infrastructure failures, and the
one-time sealed-final result.

## Build your own composition

- Add a **Target** when you want to evolve a new Harness. Define its Source,
  CandidateSeed, Solver Driver, semantic Validator, and Mutation Catalog.
- Add an **Environment** when you want a new task domain. Define task
  materialization, isolation, verifier, Result protocol, split, and metric.
- Add a **SearchStrategy** when you want a new Region-selection algorithm. It
  may return Region IDs, never file paths or credentials.
- Add an **EvolutionRecipe** when you want to recombine an existing population
  topology, branch count, budget, sharing rule, and search strategy.

The full file map, protocols, extension checklist, and test matrix are in the
[Contributor guide](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Trust and reproducibility

- Controller, Gateway, evaluator, hidden split, credentials, and promotion
  policy are outside the Candidate write set.
- Target Source, CandidateSeed, Updater distribution, Benchmark source, and
  expanded Experiment bundle are content-addressed or revision-pinned.
- Solver, Updater, verifier, and external SearchStrategy run with distinct
  isolation and least-privilege mounts.
- A Provider or verifier failure pauses the experiment instead of becoming a
  fake zero score. Resume reuses atomically committed per-task results.
- Sealed Final is unavailable during evolution and may be opened only once
  after the global best Candidate is locked.
